   I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. 
   From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future 
   beckoned and winked. […] I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree,
   starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs 
   I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant 
   losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to
   wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

Maximizing Diversity
--------------------

During the years of my undergraduate study when I concentrated primarily on 
mathematics, I stumbled upon a collection of articles written by the esteemed 
Terence Tao, offering invaluable career advice to budding mathematicians. 
In particular, his advice to `study at different places`_ really struck a chord
with me. I really took this advice to heart and made a conscious decision then 
that if I were ever to undertake graduate study, I would definitely do so at a 
different institution. Granted, I am no longer a budding mathematician, I think 
the advice just as useful and applicable to pure machine learning research, and 
computer science in general.

In particular, this is the first point he makes:

   Even the best mathematics departments do not have strengths in every field, 
   so being at several mathematics departments will broaden your education and 
   expose you to a variety of mathematical cultures, including interesting tools 
   and parts of mathematics outside of your existing fields of expertise.

Like mathematics, even the best computer science departments do not have 
strengths in every field. Having experience studying at several different 
institutions will expose me to a variety of academic research cultures and parts
of computer science and machine learning currently unfamiliar to me. He goes on 
to say:

    Furthermore, you will be able to interact over time with a greater number of
    mathematicians in your area if you study and work at different places, than 
    if you stay at a single institution; given that a significant portion of 
    one's career advancement in a field is based in part on the recognition you
    and your work receive from your peers in that field, this can thus be quite 
    beneficial to your future career in a mathematical area.

I think that in this regard, UNSW is the obvious place to be for opportunities 
to connect with a great number of top-notch computer science researchers. If we  
only include faculty that have appeared at the most selective conferences in the
major areas of computer science, UNSW has 50 and is the largest in Australia. 
In fact, it is at least twice as large as the University of Sydney, which only 
has 22 and is the 4th largest, behind Australian National University and the 
University of Melbourne [#]_.

Given my current arrangement of working with Fabio at Sydney Uni, Edwin at UNSW, 
and Richard Nock at ANU as the Data61 supervisor, not to mention continuing to 
work part-time at Data61 I think I will have plenty of opportunity to network 
and collaborate with many leading machine learning researchers over the course 
of my PhD, regardless of where I actually enroll.

Also, is is worth noting that Fabio is known for being exceptionally 
well-connected. If there is an obvious lack of expertise in a particular area
that my network of supervisors couldn't fill, I think Fabio could straight away
point me to the right person to get in touch with, wherever in the world they 
may be. 

I also get the sense that some of his students are quite well-traveled. Beyond 
attending top conferences each, which is probably the bare minimal amount of 
travel a PhD student ought to do, I know of at least one currently spending a 
year abroad, visiting the University of Washington.

Lastly, Tao says:

    Furthermore, the act of moving will help you make the (substantial) 
    psychological transition from an undergraduate student to a graduate 
    student (in which you have to go beyond rigour and proofs).

    [...]

    Staying in the same institution for these transitions may feel comforting 
    and convenient, but it can slow down one’s mathematical development.

I think this is pretty important to me.

Top School
----------

    [...] your dream school should 1) be a top school (not because it looks good
    on your resume/CV but because of feedback loops; top schools attract other 
    top people, many of whom you will get to know and work with)

    2) have a few potential advisers you would want to work with. I really do 
    mean the “few” part - this is very important and provides a safety cushion 
    for you if things don’t work out with your top choice for any one of 
    hundreds of reasons - things in many cases outside of your control, e.g. 
    your dream professor leaves, moves, or spontaneously disappears

If I am intent on staying in Sydney, or at least Australia to study for my PhD,
I don't think this point is as much of an issue for me. If there aren't any 
supervisors I can fall back to at the university I am enrolled in, I can just 
enroll at another university. 

Besides, regardless of where I end up enrolling in, I would ideally be working 
closely with both Fabio and Edwin, with one as the primary supervisor and the 
other as the co-supervisor. Where I enroll will determine who my primary 
supervisor is, or more to the point, who I choose to be my primary supervisor 
will determine where I enroll. 

If whomever ends up being my primary supervisor leaves, the logical course of 
action would be to just enroll at the institution my co-supervisor is at. That 
would just be a matter of applying to that institution, and it is relatively 
straightforward to apply to a PhD program at most universities in Australia. If 
you've already applied and been accepted previously, there is practically no 
additional work required. There is also the issue of transferring over the 
Research Training Program (RTP) Stipend, which just requires filling out some 
annoying paperwork.

    3) be in a good environment physically. I don’t think new admits appreciate 
    this enough: you will spend 5+ years of your really good years living near 
    the school campus. Trust me, this is a long time and your life will consist 
    of much more than just research.

This consideration is significant to me. 

    **Pre-vs-post tenure.** Every adviser is different so it's helpful to 
    understand the axes of variations and their repercussions on your PhD 
    experience. As one rule of thumb (and keep in mind there are many 
    exceptions), it's important to keep track of whether a potential adviser is 
    pre-tenure or post-tenure. [...]

While Australia does not really have a tenure system like that of the US, I 
think this applies directly to academic titles and ranks. 

While they both completed their PhD in 2008, Fabio and Edwin seem to have very
different research and academic goals. This is reflected in their current 
academic ranks, publication record, past and present students, postdoctoral 
fellows, etc.

In particular, Fabio is a Associate Professor. He is currently supervising 
around 10 PhD students. As far as I know, he has produced at least a dozen PhDs.
It feels like he always has a handful of postdocs and visiting research fellows
at any given time.

In contrast, Edwin is a Senior Lecturer. He is currently supervising 1 PhD 
student and, to the best of my knowledge, has only graduated 1 PhD. He is known
to be highly selective with PhD candidates. Jointly with Fabio, he recently 
hired postdoc who will be primarily based at Sydney Uni.

    [...] The younger faculty members will usually be around more (they are 
    working hard to get tenure) and will usually be more low-level, have 
    stronger opinions on what you should be working on, they'll do math with 
    you, pitch concrete ideas, or even look at (or contribute to) your code. 
    This is a much more hands-on and possibly intense experience because the 
    adviser will need a strong publication record to get tenure and they are 
    incentivised to push you to work just as hard. 

    In contrast, more senior faculty members may have larger labs and tend to 
    have many other commitments (e.g. committees, talks, travel) other than research, which means that they can only afford to stay on a higher level of
    abstraction both in the area of their research and in the level of 
    supervision for their students. To caricature, it’s a difference between 
    "you're missing a second term in that equation" and "you may want to read up more in this area, talk to this or that person, and sell your work this or 
    that way". In the latter case, the low-level advice can still come from the 
    senior PhD students in the lab or the postdocs.

    **Axes of variation.** There are many other axes to be aware of. Some advisers are fluffy and some prefer to keep your relationship very professional. Some will try to exercise a lot of influence on the details of your work and some are much more hands off. Some will have a focus on specific models and their applications to various tasks while some will focus on tasks and more indifference towards any particular modeling approach. In terms of more managerial properties, some will meet you every week (or day!) multiple times and some you won’t see for months. Some advisers answer emails right away and some don’t answer email for a week (or ever, haha). Some advisers make demands about your work schedule (e.g. you better work long hours or weekends) and some won’t. Some advisers generously support their students with equipment and some think laptops or old computers are mostly fine. Some advisers will fund you to go to a conferences even if you don’t have a paper there and some won’t. Some advisers are entrepreneurial or applied and some lean more towards theoretical work. Some will let you do summer internships and some will consider internships just a distraction.


    **Collecting references.** You should also collect references on your potential adviser. One good strategy is to talk to their students. If you want to get actual information this shouldn’t be done in a very formal way or setting but in a relaxed environment or mood (e.g. a party). In many cases the students might still avoid saying bad things about the adviser if asked in a general manner, but they will usually answer truthfully when you ask specific questions, e.g. “how often do you meet?”, or “how hands on are they?”. Another strategy is to look at where their previous students ended up (you can usually find this on the website under an alumni section), which of course also statistically informs your own eventual outcome.

    **Consider the entire lab.** Another important point to realize is that you’ll be seeing your adviser maybe once a week but you’ll be seeing most of their students every single day in the lab and they will go on to become your closest friends. In most cases you will also end up collaborating with some of the senior PhD students or postdocs and they will play a role very similar to that of your adviser. The postdocs, in particular, are professors-in-training and they will likely be eager to work with you as they are trying to gain advising experience they can point to for their academic job search. Therefore, you want to make sure the entire group has people you can get along with, people you respect and who you can work with closely on research projects.

Funding for attending conferences


  There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.
