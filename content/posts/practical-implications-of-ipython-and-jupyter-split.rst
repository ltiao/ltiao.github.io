A lot of recent effort has been made to fully decouple the IPython kernel
from the IPython Notebook, which is now called Jupyter. This effort is obvious
in the latest IPython 4.0 update, released a few days ago. The details of this 
release are outlined in http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/08/12/first-release-of-jupyter/.
