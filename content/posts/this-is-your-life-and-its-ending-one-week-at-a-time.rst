One of the most influential quotes is from `On the Shortness of Life`_ by Seneca:

..  pull-quote::

    You live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty
    ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed.
    You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all
    the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your
    last.

    -- Seneca, `On the Shortness of Life`_

.. TEASER_END

..  pull-quote::

    Every third thought shall be my grave.

    -- William Shakespeare, The Tempest
