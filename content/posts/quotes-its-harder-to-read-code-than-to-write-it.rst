   We're programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the 
   first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place
   flat and build something grand. We're not excited by incremental renovation:
   tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.

   There's a subtle reason that programmers always want to throw away the code 
   and start over. The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And 
   here is the interesting observation: they are probably wrong. The reason 
   that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental
   law of programming:

   Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it.
