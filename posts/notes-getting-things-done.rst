   Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. In fact, life itself 
   is nothing more than one long practice session, an endless effort of 
   refining our motions. When the proper mechanics of practice are understood, 
   the task of learning something new becomes a stress-free experience of joy 
   and calmness, a process which settles all areas in your life and promotes 
   proper perspective on all of lifeâ€™s difficulties.

   -- Thomas M. Sterner, The Practicing Mind: Developing Focus and Discipline 
   in Your Life
