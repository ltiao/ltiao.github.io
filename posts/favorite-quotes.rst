.. pull-quote::

   It does not take much strength to do things, but it requires a great deal 
   of strength to decide what to do.

   -- Elbert Hubbard

.. pull-quote::

   Common sense is instinct, and enough of it is genius.

   -- Josh Billings

.. pull-quote::

   Every single day, you’re the result of what you did on the days prior.

   So if you turn that around, you can start turning yourself into who you 
   want to be, based on what you decide to do today. What food do you put in 
   your mouth? What book do you read? What movie do you watch? What do you do 
   with your spare time? Do you study, do you learn something?

   If you make deliberate choices with your life, it’s amazing, after a week 
   or a month or a year, the changes that you can effect. And you literally 
   turn yourself into the person that you want to become.

   -- Chris Hadfield, `How You Can Achieve Your Goals <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGrzo4IvXyg>`_


.. pull-quote::

   Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. In fact, life itself 
   is nothing more than one long practice session, an endless effort of 
   refining our motions. When the proper mechanics of practice are understood, 
   the task of learning something new becomes a stress-free experience of joy 
   and calmness, a process which settles all areas in your life and promotes 
   proper perspective on all of life’s difficulties.

   -- Thomas M. Sterner, The Practicing Mind: Developing Focus and Discipline 
   in Your Life

.. pull-quote::

   You are going to find that buying the car is much less satisfying than 
   working for it.

   -- Thomas M. Sterner

Persistence
-----------

.. pull-quote::

   When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away 
   at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in 
   it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it 
   was not that last blow that did it, but all that had gone before

   -- Jacob A. Riis

Consciousness
-------------

.. pull-quote::

   If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so 
   simple that we couldn't.

   -- Ian Stewart, The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World

Science

.. pull-quote::

   Somewhere something incredible is waiting to be known.

   -- Carl Sagan


.. pull-quote::

   Seeing much, suffering much, and studying much, are the three pillars of 
   learning.

   -- Benjamin Disraeli

.. pull-quote::

   We must get beyond textbooks, go out into the bypaths... 
   and tell the world the glories of our journey. 

   -- John Hope Franklin

.. pull-quote::
   
   I'm quite illiterate, but I read a lot.

   -- J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye

Motivation
----------

.. pull-quote::

   If I quit now, I will soon be back to where I started.

   And when I started, I was desperately wishing to be where I am now.

.. pull-quote::

   I may not be there yet, but I'm closer than I was yesterday.

.. pull-quote::

   Whenever you don't feel like doing something is probably you need 
   to be doing it the most.

.. pull-quote::

   Never give up on a dream because of the time it will take to accomplish it. 
   The time will pass anyway.

   -- Earl Nightingale

Meta
****

.. pull-quote::

   People often say that motivation doesn't last. Well, neither does 
   bathing - that's why we recommend it daily.

   -- Zig Ziglar

Self-discipline
---------------

.. pull-quote::

   What hurts more, the pain of hard work or the pain of regret?

.. pull-quote::

   Work hard in silence; let success make the noise.

.. pull-quote::

   Success isn't owned, it is leased. And rent is due every day.

   -- J.J. Watt

.. pull-quote::

   If you don't make time to work on creating the life you want, you're
   eventually going to be forced to spend a *lot* of time dealing with 
   a life you don't want.

   -- Kevin Ngo

.. pull-quote::

   `(expletive)` motivation. it’s a fickle and unreliable little `(expletive)`
   and isn’t worth your time.

   Better to cultivate discipline than to rely on motivation. 
   Force yourself to do things. Force yourself to get up out of 
   bed and practice. Force yourself to work. Motivation is fleeting 
   and it’s easy to rely on because it requires no concentrated 
   effort to get. Motivation comes to you, and you don’t have 
   to chase after it.

   Discipline is reliable, motivation is fleeting. The question 
   isn’t how to keep yourself motivated. It’s how to train 
   yourself to work without it.


Failure and Success
-------------------

.. pull-quote::

   While one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other 
   is busy making mistakes and becoming superior.

   -- Henry C. Link

Girls
-----

.. pull-quote::

   That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if
   they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall in
   love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls.
   Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.

   -- J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye
