Installation
------------

First, create a ``virtualenv``

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkvirtualenv <venv_name>

Now, install Nikola

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install nikola

There are a lot of optional dependencies, the bulk of which can be installed like
this

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install nikola[extras]

If we use a feature that has missing dependencies, we will be informed anyways, 
so let's just go with a minimal installation and install any dependencies later on 
as needed.

On Mac OS X, even with XCode installed and fully up-to-date, you may still encounter 
the following error

.. code-block:: console

   In file included from src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:346:
   $WORKON_HOME/venv_name/build/lxml/src/lxml/includes/etree_defs.h:9:10: fatal error: 'libxml/xmlversion.h' file not found
   #include "libxml/xmlversion.h"
            ^
   1 error generated.
   error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

The simple fix is to install ``lxml`` by itself first with the ``STATIC_DEPS`` set 
to ``true``, and then try installing Nikola again

.. code-block:: console

   $ STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml
   $ pip install nikola

Initialization
--------------

Now we're ready to initialize the site

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola init <site_root>
   Creating Nikola Site
   ==================== 

   This is Nikola v7.3.1.  We will now ask you a few easy questions about your new site.
   If you do not want to answer and want to go with the defaults instead, simply restart with the `-q` parameter.
   --- Questions about the site ---
   Site title [My Nikola Site]: Louis Tiao
   Site author [Nikola Tesla]: Louis Tiao
   Site author's e-mail [n.tesla@example.com]: louistiao@me.com
   Site description [This is a demo site for Nikola.]: Computer Science / Math / Software Engineering
   Site URL [http://getnikola.com/]: http://ltiao.github.io/
   --- Questions about languages and locales ---
   We will now ask you to provide the list of languages you want to use.
   Please list all the desired languages, comma-separated, using ISO 639-1 codes.  The first language will be used as the default.
   Type '?' (a question mark, sans quotes) to list available languages.
   Language(s) to use [en]:  

   Please choose the correct time zone for your blog. Nikola uses the tz database.
   You can find your time zone here:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones 

   Time zone [Australia/Sydney]: 
       Current time in Australia/Sydney: 23:03:16
   Use this time zone? [Y/n] Y
   --- Questions about comments ---
   You can configure comments now.  Type '?' (a question mark, sans quotes) to list available comment systems.  If you do not want any comments, just leave the field blank.
   Comment system: ? 

   # Available comment systems:
   #   disqus, facebook, googleplus, intensedebate, isso, livefyre, muut 

   Comment system: disqus
   You need to provide the site identifier for your comment system.  Consult the Nikola manual for details on what the value should be.  (you can leave it empty and come back later)
   Comment system site identifier: ltiao 

   That's it, Nikola is now configured.  Make sure to edit conf.py to your liking.
   If you are looking for themes and addons, check out http://themes.getnikola.com/ and http://plugins.getnikola.com/.
   Have fun!
   [2015-03-15T12:03:26Z] INFO: init: Created empty site at ltiao.github.io.

Note that this also works on an existing directory [#]_, so you can create a repository 
on Github (which conveniently generates ``README``, ``LICENSE``, ``.gitignore`` 
files for you), clone it into ``<site_root>``, and then execute the above 
initialization command. Or you can initialize the site first, and then initialize 
the git repository. Whatever tickles your fancy.

Create Demo Posts
-----------------

Similar to Octopress, but unlike Pelican [#]_, Nikola provides you with commands for
post and page creation

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola help new_post
   Purpose: create a new blog post or site page
   Usage:   nikola new_post [options] [path] 

   Options:
     -p, --page                Create a page instead of a blog post. (see also: `nikola new_page`)
     -t ARG, --title=ARG       Title for the post.
     -a ARG, --author=ARG      Author of the post.
     --tags=ARG                Comma-separated tags for the post.
     -1                        Create the post with embedded metadata (single file format)
     -2                        Create the post with separate metadata (two file format)
     -e                        Open the post (and meta file, if any) in $EDITOR after creation.
     -f ARG, --format=ARG      Markup format for the post, one of rest, markdown, wiki, bbcode, html, textile, txt2tags
     -s                        Schedule the post based on recurrence rule
     -i ARG, --import=ARG      Import an existing file instead of creating a placeholder 

   $ nikola help new_page
   Purpose: create a new page in the site
   Usage:   nikola new_page [options] [path] 

   Options:
     -t ARG, --title=ARG       Title for the page.
     -a ARG, --author=ARG      Author of the post.
     -1                        Create the page with embedded metadata (single file format)
     -2                        Create the page with separate metadata (two file format)
     -e                        Open the page (and meta file, if any) in $EDITOR after creation.
     -f ARG, --format=ARG      Markup format for the page, one of rest, markdown, wiki, bbcode, html, textile, txt2tags
     -i ARG, --import=ARG      Import an existing file instead of creating a placeholder

Let's go ahead and create a new post. I mostly care about how code blocks, mathematical
expressions and other ReStructuredText extensions appear, so let's create a post with
these syntax contructs. A good starting point is the `reStructuredText Demonstration`_.
Download the `source`_ as a ``.txt`` file and useÂ it as as starting point for our new post

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola new_post --title="ReStructuredText Demo" --import=demo.txt 
   Importing Existing Post
   ----------------------- 

   Title: ReStructuredText Demo
   Scanning posts....done!
   [2015-03-16T04:01:39Z] INFO: new_post: Your post's text is at: posts/restructuredtext-demo.rst

Note that some metadata is generated for us at the top, along with the contents
of ``demo.txt``

.. code-block:: rst

   .. title: ReStructuredText Demo
   .. slug: restructuredtext-demo
   .. date: 2015-03-16 02:02:07 UTC+11:00

   ...

For the most part, this looks pretty good.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo.png
   
There's something funky going on with the footnotes and citations

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_footnotes.png

It appears some the text color of some citations are white; they
become visible when we highlight it. 

Obviously, we haven't included the images corresponding to the demo,
or even set up our images directory yet.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_images.png

So let's go ahead and do just that.

Images
******

The default image-related options in ``conf.py`` are as follows

.. code-block:: python

   # #############################################################################
   # Image Gallery Options
   # ############################################################################# 

   # One or more folders containing galleries. The format is a dictionary of
   # {"source": "relative_destination"}, where galleries are looked for in
   # "source/" and the results will be located in
   # "OUTPUT_PATH/relative_destination/gallery_name"
   # Default is:
   GALLERY_FOLDERS = {"galleries": "galleries"}
   # More gallery options:
   THUMBNAIL_SIZE = 180
   MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = 1280
   USE_FILENAME_AS_TITLE = True
   EXTRA_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = [] 

   # If set to False, it will sort by filename instead. Defaults to True
   GALLERY_SORT_BY_DATE = True 

   # Folders containing images to be used in normal posts or
   # pages. Images will be scaled down according to IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_SIZE
   # and MAX_IMAGE_SIZE options, but will have to be referenced manually
   # to be visible on the site. The format is a dictionary of {source:
   # relative destination}.
   IMAGE_FOLDERS = {'images': ''}
   IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_SIZE = 400

So let's create an ``images`` directory, and a subdirectory for the images 
related to our demo

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir <site_root>/images
   $ mkdir <site_root>/images/rest_demo

Next, download the images in http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/images/ and
place them in the subdirectory we just created

.. code-block:: console

   $ wget -nd -r -l 1 -P images/rest_demo/ -A jpeg,jpg,png,bmp,gif http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/images/

In the ``posts/restructuredtext-demo.rst`` file, we must now update all occurrences of
``images/`` to ``../rest_demo/``.

Now we should see

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_images_fixed.png

To reference the contents of the ``images`` directory within our post, 
we use ``../``, since the images and its thumbnails are outputted to
to the ``output`` directory by default. Since our posts are outputted to
``output/posts``, it makes sense that we reference the parent directory.

If we update the ``IMAGE_FOLDERS`` setting to

.. code-block:: python

   IMAGE_FOLDERS = {'images': 'images'}

the images will be outputted to ``output/images``, (which makes more sense in my opinion.) 
But now, we must remember to update ``../rest_demo/`` to ``../images/rest_demo/``!

Extensions
**********

Now let's check out some of the directives and roles that are not part of Docutils
but are supported by Nikola.

Code Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `code directive`_ has been part of Docutils since version 0.9 and two aliases,
``code-block`` and ``sourcecode`` are also supported.

Let's add the following code block to the demo and see how it looks::

  .. code-block:: python
     :number-lines:

     def sieve_of_eratosthenes():
         factors = defaultdict(set)
         for n in count(2):
             if factors[n]:
                 for m in factors.pop(n):
                     factors[n+m].add(m)
             else:
                 factors[n*n].add(n)
                 yield n

Seems to look alright.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_code_default.png

For any theme that uses Pygments (e.g. the default themes), we can modify
the color scheme to any one of

- autumn
- borland 
- bw 
- colorful 
- default 
- emacs 
- friendly 
- fruity 
- manni
- monokai 
- murphy 
- native 
- pastie 
- perldoc 
- rrt 
- tango 
- trac 
- vim 
- vs

You can use `Pygments online demo`_ to see how each of these styles look.

.. code-block:: python

   # Color scheme to be used for code blocks. If your theme provides
   # "assets/css/code.css" this is ignored.
   # Can be any of autumn borland bw colorful default emacs friendly fruity manni
   # monokai murphy native pastie perldoc rrt tango trac vim vs
   CODE_COLOR_SCHEME = 'default'

Obviously (and as noted in the comments), if you provide your own ``assets/css/code.css``,
this setting will have no effect. (If you want to dig in to the asset-copying mechanism, 
take a look at `copy_assets.py`_.)

If you did dive in to that file, you'll probably notice that you have access to
more color schemes than just those listed above. To list your available styles,
run:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from pygments.styles import get_all_styles
   >>> sorted(list(get_all_styles()))
   ['autumn', 'borland', 'bw', 'colorful', 'default', 'emacs', 'friendly', 'fruity', 'igor', 'manni', 'monokai', 'murphy', 'native', 'paraiso-dark', 'paraiso-light', 'pastie', 'perldoc', 'rrt', 'tango', 'trac', 'vim', 'vs', 'xcode']

Let's go ahead and check out ``xcode``.

.. code-block:: python

   CODE_COLOR_SCHEME = 'xcode'

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_code_xcode.png

In the end, I still think ``default`` looks best so I stuck with it.

MathJax
~~~~~~~

The next thing I care most about is how mathematical expressions are rendered.
Mathematical expressions can be displayed *inline* using the math **role**::

  While displaying equations look good for a page of samples, the 
  ability to mix math and text in a paragraph is also important.  
  This expression :math:`\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2` is an example of an 
  inline equation. As you see, MathJax equations can be used this 
  way as well, without unduly disturbing the spacing between lines.

while equations can be displayed with the math **directive**::

  Here are some remarkable equations

  An Identity of Ramanujan
  ************************

  .. math::

     \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi) e^{\frac25 \pi}} =
     1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}}
     {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }

  Maxwell's Equations
  *******************

  .. math::

     \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\
     \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
     \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
     \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0

Let's see what we get

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_math_no_tag.png

Oops... That's not what we want. Turns out, we forgot to add the ``mathjax`` tag 
to the post's tags metadata::

  .. title: ReStructuredText Demo
  .. slug: restructuredtext-demo
  .. date: 2015-03-16 15:01:39 UTC+11:00
  .. tags: mathjax
  .. category: 
  .. link: 
  .. description: 
  .. type: text

Now we're in business.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_math_tag.png

Note that these examples were ripped off from http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/test/sample.html.

Doc
~~~

I'm not that fussy about the other roles and directives, and I doubt I will need to
use them very much. The last one that I will really need is the ``doc`` role, which
allows you to link to other pages and articles.

Let's add a link to this post in our demo post::

  This post is a demo for :doc:`how-i-customized-my-nikola-powered-site`.

This will use the post's title as the link's text. Alternatively, we 
can define our own text::

  This post is a demo for :doc:`my interesting post <how-i-customized-my-nikola-powered-site>`.

You can see the demo post :doc:`here <restructuredtext-demo>`.

IPython Notebooks
*****************

Support for writing content IPython Notebooks is a big deal for me,
and is the whole reason I switched to Nikola. Unlike Pelican, Nikola
support for IPython Notebooks is built in, and there's no need to mess
around with all the hacky plugins that Pelican requires.

First, let's add ``*.ipynb`` files as a source format

.. code-block:: python

   POSTS = (
       ("posts/*.rst", "posts", "post.tmpl"),
       ("posts/*.txt", "posts", "post.tmpl"),
       ("posts/*.ipynb", "posts", "post.tmpl"),
   ) 

Otherwise you'll encounter the exception::

  Exception: Can't find a way, using your configuration, to create a post in format ipynb. You may want to tweak COMPILERS or POSTS in conf.py

Now let's create some example notebooks, starting with the sample notebook
for demonstrating `IPython's Rich Display System`_ and `Typesetting Equations`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola new_post --title="IPython Notebook Demo" --format=ipynb --import=Display\ System.ipynb
   Importing Existing Post
   ----------------------- 

   Title: IPython Notebook Demo
   Scanning posts.....done!
   [2015-03-16T10:54:19Z] WARNING: new_post: This compiler does not support one-file posts.
   [2015-03-16T10:54:19Z] INFO: new_post: Your post's metadata is at: posts/ipython-notebook-demo.meta
   [2015-03-16T10:54:19Z] INFO: new_post: Your post's text is at: posts/ipython-notebook-demo.ipynb

This looks promising, but it doesn't have the nice `In [#]` / `Out [#]`
formatting we're so used to seeing from IPython. Also, the tables look
a bit condensed.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_ipython_initial.png

The MathJax equations are also problematic

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_ipython_initial_math.png

Luckily, this is easily fixed by installing the ``ipython`` theme.

To see the list of available themes from the default repository,
run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola install_theme --list
   INFO:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTP connection (1): themes.getnikola.com
   Themes:
   -------
   blogtxt
   bootstrap3-gradients
   bootstrap3-gradients-jinja
   ipython
   ipython-xkcd
   monospace
   oldfashioned
   planetoid
   readable
   reveal
   reveal-jinja
   zen
   zen-ipython
   zen-jinja

Note that the default themes such as ``bootstrap3`` are shipped with Nikola
and lives in ``$WORKON_HOME/<venv_name>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nikola/data/themes/``.

Let's just go ahead and install ``ipython``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola install_theme ipython
   INFO:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTP connection (1): themes.getnikola.com
   [2015-03-16T11:07:25Z] INFO: install_theme: Downloading 'http://themes.getnikola.com/v7/ipython.zip'
   INFO:requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTP connection (1): themes.getnikola.com
   [2015-03-16T11:07:26Z] INFO: install_theme: Extracting 'ipython' into themes/
   [2015-03-16T11:07:26Z] NOTICE: install_theme: Remember to set THEME="ipython" in conf.py to use this theme.

This creates the directory ``themes`` in under ``<site_root>``. Let's
now set this as our theme (``conf.py``):

.. code-block:: python

   # Name of the theme to use.
   THEME = "ipython"

That's better.

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_ipython_themed.png

.. thumbnail:: ../images/rest_demo_ipython_themed_math.png

But wait! The inline math expressions are still not rendered correctly.
To fix this, we need to set the ``MATHJAX_CONFIG`` (in ``conf.py``):

.. code-block:: python

   # If you are using the compile-ipynb plugin, just add this one:
   MATHJAX_CONFIG = """
   <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
   MathJax.Hub.Config({
       tex2jax: {
           inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\\(","\\\)"] ],
           displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\\[","\\\]"] ],
           processEscapes: true
       },
       displayAlign: 'left', // Change this to 'center' to center equations.
       "HTML-CSS": {
           styles: {'.MathJax_Display': {"margin": 0}}
       }
   });
   </script>
  """

And with that, we seem to be in a good way.

.. thumbnail::  ../images/rest_demo_ipython_mathjax.png

You can see the demo post :doc:`here <ipython-notebook-demo>`.

Deployment
----------

At this point, I'm assuming your Git repository is initialized but
nothing has been commited yet. If this is not the case, you should
consider starting a fresh repository, unless you really know what
you are doing.

Since we're using a Github User / Organization page, the output of
the site must be pushed to the ``master`` branch. But we still need
to track our sources. So first we create a ``source`` branch. Note
that by default, Nikola assumes the branch to be named ``deploy``, 
but I find that kind of confusing.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git checkout -b source

.. code-block:: python

   # For user.github.io OR organization.github.io pages, the DEPLOY branch
   # MUST be 'master', and 'gh-pages' for other repositories.
   GITHUB_SOURCE_BRANCH = 'source'
   GITHUB_DEPLOY_BRANCH = 'master'
   
   # The name of the remote where you wish to push to, using github_deploy.
   # GITHUB_REMOTE_NAME = 'origin'

Now, let's track and commit the relevant source files, which so far is 
just `posts/`, `images/`, `conf.py`.

.. code-block:: console

  $ echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
  $ echo .ipynb_checkpoints >> .gitignore
  $ git add conf.py images/ posts/
  $ git commit -a -m 'initial commit'

And we should push it to Github:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git push origin source
   Counting objects: 40, done.
   Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
   Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (21/21), 2.64 MiB | 264.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 21 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
   To https://github.com/ltiao/ltiao.github.io.git
    * [new branch]      source -> source

We're also ready to deploy to Github Pages:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola github_deploy
   Scanning posts.....done!
   Scanning posts.....done!
   [2015-03-16T13:05:50Z] INFO: github_deploy: ==> ['ghp-import', '-n', '-m', u'Nikola auto commit.\n\nSource commit: 708c86073cf740997166eacfdb65851acfa74b9d\nNikola version: 7.3.1', '-p', '-r', u'origin', '-b', u'master', u'output']

   To https://github.com/ltiao/ltiao.github.io.git
      f8605ee..e159dec  master -> master

.. Caution::

   The ``nikola github_deploy`` doesn't seem to generate the required thumbnails
   for the **thumbnail** directive.

Theme Customization
-------------------

This is optional, but since I want to be able to distribute
my custom theme, and also reuse it in other projects, I created 
a new repository on Github, and chose the ``Sass`` option for the
``.gitignore`` file. Next I clone it into ``<site_root>/themes``.

Now, let's create a new theme based on ``ipython`` using the 
Bootswatch theme ``yeti`` (which is basically the default Foundation
look implemented in Bootstrap.)

.. code-block:: console

   $ nikola help bootswatch_theme
   Purpose: given a swatch name from bootswatch.com and a parent theme, creates a custom theme
   Usage:   nikola bootswatch_theme [options] 

   Options:
     -n ARG, --name=ARG        New theme name (default: custom)
     -s ARG                    Name of the swatch from bootswatch.com.
     -p ARG, --parent=ARG      Parent theme name (default: bootstrap3)

   $ nikola bootswatch_theme --name=tiao --parent=ipython -s yeti

.. Caution::

   You're likely to encounter the exception::

     SSLError: hostname 'bootswatch.com' doesn't match either of 'ssl2000.cloudflare.com', 'cloudflare.com', '*.cloudflare.com'

   The quick fix if you're desperate to get up and running is to add the keyword
   argument ``verify=False`` to the call to the ``get`` method on `line 100`_ of 
   ``bootswatch_theme.py``. But for the sake of security, you'd better wait for
   this to be fixed.

.. Note:: I'd much prefer it if we could specify a Bootswatch theme in
   the configuration file since it wouldn't be too difficult to support.
   As it is, we must create a custom theme if we want to use a different
   Bootswatch theme.

Now we can set our theme to ``tiao``.

.. code-block:: python

   THEME = 'tiao'

and we should now see a ``yeti`` version of our site.

.. thumbnail

I don't think navigation bars are well-suited personal websites and blogs,
and that's the main thing I want to address with my custom theme.

To do this, we must modify the base template ``base.tmpl``. Let's first copy
it from the parent and take it from there. You'll note that ``ipython`` does 
not actually have a ``base.tmpl``, it uses its parent's, namely ``bootstrap3-jinja``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ls themes/ipython/templates/
   base_helper.tmpl  index.tmpl    post.tmpl
 
   $ cat themes/ipython/parent
   bootstrap3-jinja

   $ mkdir themes/tiao/templates
   
   $ cp $WORKON_HOME/<venv_name>/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nikola/data/themes/bootstrap3-jinja/templates/base.tmpl themes/tiao/templates/base.tmpl

Now we replace every between ``<!-- Menubar --> ... <!-- End of Menubar -->`` with

.. code-block:: html

   <div class="container">
       <div class="page-header">
           <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
               {% if search_form %}
               <li>{{ search_form }}</li>
               {% endif %}
               {% block belowtitle %}
               {% if translations|length > 1 %}
                   <li>{{ base.html_translations() }}</li>
               {% endif %}
               {% endblock %}
               {% if show_sourcelink %}
                   {% block sourcelink %}{% endblock %}
               {% endif %}
               {{ template_hooks['menu_alt']() }}
           </ul>
           <a  href="{{ abs_link(_link("root", None, lang)) }}">
               {% if logo_url %}
                   <img src="{{ logo_url }}" alt="{{ blog_title }}" id="logo">
               {% endif %}    
               <h2 class="text-muted">
               {% if show_blog_title %}
                   <span id="blog-title"><strong>{{ blog_title }}</strong></span>
               {% endif %}
               </h2>
           </a>
       </div> <!-- ./page-header -->
   </div> <!-- ./container -->

We also replace the body by

.. code-block:: html

   <div class="container" id="content" role="main">
       <div class="row">
           <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">
               <ul class="nav nav-pills nav-stacked">
                   {{ base.html_navigation_links() }}
                   {{ template_hooks['menu']() }}
               </ul>
           </div> <!-- ./col -->
           <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
               <div class="body-content">
                   <!--Body content-->
                   <div class="row">
                       {{ template_hooks['page_header']() }}
                       {% block content %}{% endblock %}
                   </div>
                   <!--End of body content-->
               </div>
           </div> <!-- ./col -->
       </div> <!-- ./row -->  
   </div> <!-- ./container --> 

   <footer>
       <div class="container">
           {{ content_footer }}
           {{ template_hooks['page_footer']() }}
       </div>
   </footer>

and lastly create ``assets/css/custom.css``, add

.. code-block:: css

   html {
     position: relative;
     min-height: 100%;
   } 

   body {
     margin-top: 5px;
     /* Margin bottom by footer height */
     margin-bottom: 60px;
   } 

   .footer {
     position: absolute;
     bottom: 0;
     width: 100%;
     /* Set the fixed height of the footer here */
     height: 60px;
     background-color: #f5f5f5;
   } 

   .footer .text-muted {
     margin: 20px 0;
   }

What this does is summarized below: 

1. Created a page header in place of the navigation bar
2. Reduce the top margin to 5 pixels
3. Created a sidebar to contain all the navigation links, i.e. the main menu.
4. Created navigation pills, pulled to the right on the page header,
   which contains the search form, source link and translation links, i.e. the alt menu.
5. Stick the footer to the bottom, loosely based on the Bootstrap `Sticky footer example`_
   and its corresponding `CSS file`_.

.. [#] Unlike the initialization commands of more prominent projects, such as Django
   (``django-admin.py startproject``), Scrapy (``scrapy startproject``) and probably others.
.. [#] Admittedly not a huge predicament since one can trivially implement such a command
   in Pelican, given that projects come equipped with a ``fabfile.py`` and a ``Makefile``,
   that makes extensive use of it.
