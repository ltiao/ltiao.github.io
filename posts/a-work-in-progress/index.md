It's been a long time since my last post. A lot has happened since, and I am undergoing even more significant change currently.

I don't really know why or for whom I am writing this. I am reminded of the
opening to a letter Bruce Lee penned to himself during one of the busiest times 
in his life, titled [In My Own Process][1]:

> At the moment Iâ€™m wondering for whom am I writing this organized mess? 
> I have to say I am writing whatever wants to be written.

I suppose I am writing this for nobody but myself. I am just writing whatever 
wants to be written.
