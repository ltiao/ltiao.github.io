Advanced Topics in Statistical Machine Learning (COMP9418) - `UNSW Sydney`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Semester 2 2017, I was a teaching assistant for "Advanced Topics in 
Statistical Machine Learning" (COMP9418_), a brand new course created and taught 
by the brilliant `Edwin Bonilla`_. 
The course has a primary focus on probabilistic machine learning methods, 
covering the topics of exact and approximate inference in directed and 
undirected probabilistic graphical models - continuous latent variable 
models, structured prediction models, and non-parametric models based on 
Gaussian processes.

   Lab exercise on Gaussian Process Regression, running in `JupyterLab`_. 

This course has a major emphasis on maintaining a good balance between theory 
and practice. My primary responsibility was to create lab exercises that 
aid students in gaining hands-on experience with these methods, specifically
applying them to real-world data using the most current tools and libraries. 
The labs were Python-based, and relied heavily on the Python scientific 
computing and data analysis stack (NumPy_, SciPy_, Matplotlib_, Seaborn_, 
Pandas_, `IPython/Jupyter notebooks`_), and the popular machine learning 
libraries `scikit-learn`_ and TensorFlow_. 

Students were given the chance to experiment with a broad range of methods 
on various problems, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian 
logistic regression, probabilistic PCA (PPCA), factor analysis (FA) and 
independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction, hidden 
Markov models (HMMs) for speech recognition, conditional random fields (CRFs) 
for named-entity recognition, and Gaussian processes (GPs) for regression and
classification.
