Hi. My name is Louis. I am a lifelong student and aspiring researcher of 
Computer Science and Mathematics.

I graduated with First-class Honours in Computer Science from the 
`University of New South Wales`_, where I minored in Mathematics and 
concentrated on Algorithm Design and Analysis, Theoretical Computer Science, 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I am currently a Software Engineer at `Data61 | CSIRO`_  (formerly `NICTA`_) on
the `Spatial Inference Systems Team`_, where I work among a group of leading 
Machine Learning researchers and engineers with expertise in Nonparametric 
Bayesian Inference.

In my spare time, if I am not working on one of my `many incomplete side 
projects`_, you'll either find me shooting hoops at the gym or on the mats 
training jiujitsu, in all likelihood being strangled, often by smaller opponents.

Check out :doc:`my projects <projects>` for the things I've built and 
:doc:`my dev stack <development-stack>` for what I build things with.

..  My current research interests are

    * Algorithm / Data Structure Design and Analysis 
    * Machine Learning / Statistics / Data Mining
    * Artificial Intelligence
    * Discrete Mathematics
    * Combinatorial Optimization
    * Computability Theory
    * Complexity Theory

    On the less theoretical CS aspect of things, I am a full-stack software engineer, 
    with experience in

    * Server administration, virtualization, networking, and hosting environments 
      (e.g. Amazon EC2, Heroku, DigitalOcean)
    * Database administration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) 
    * Database design / Data modeling
    * Web application frameworks (e.g. Django, Flask) / RESTful APIs
    * User Interface (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, etc.)
      
      - Data Visualization (D3.js, Google Charts, HighCharts JS)

    I am highly effective in Python, and use it regularly for such things as

    * Numerical analysis / scientific computing - (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython[Notebook], scikit-learn)
    * Web data extraction (web scraping/crawling) - (Scrapy + lxml, requests + BeautifulSoup)
    * Network analysis - (NetworkX)
    * *Solving almost any other type of problem*

    Nowadays, though I generally use high-level programming languages such as Python, C++, 
    Java and Haskell, I worked almost exclusively in my earlier days with programming 
    languages such as C and assembly (AVR), for low-level applications such as programming 
    microprocessors (Atmel AVR) or implementing the filesystem and virtual memory for an 
    (educational) operating system (OS/161).
