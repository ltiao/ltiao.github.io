Hi. My name is Louis. I am a budding machine learning research scientist and a 
current PhD candidate at the `University of Sydney`_ under `Fabio Ramos`_. 
I am also advised by `Edwin Bonilla`_ and `Richard Nock`_.
My main research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, 
deep learning and implicit probabilistic models.

I have a thorough background in computer science and mathematics. Previously, 
I studied computer science at the `University of New South Wales`_ (UNSW), 
where I had a major emphasis on algorithm design and analysis, theoretical 
computer science, programming language theory, artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, and a minor emphasis on mathematics and statistics. 
I undertook my final-year thesis under `Aleksandar Ignjatovic`_, and graduated 
with first-class honours in 2015.

Until 2017, I was a software engineer at `NICTA`_ (now incorporated under 
`CSIRO`_ as `Data61`_) in the `Inference systems group`_, where I worked with a
team of experienced machine learning researchers and engineers with expertise in 
Bayesian machine learning. I now work at Data61 on a part-time basis when I am 
not :doc:`teaching <teaching>`.

In my spare time, if I am not working on one of my `many incomplete side 
projects`_, you'll either find me shooting hoops at the gym, or on the mats 
training in the beautiful art of `Brazilian jiu jitsu`_.

Check out my :doc:`projects <projects>` for the things I've built and my 
:doc:`dev stack <development-stack>` for what I love to build things with.
