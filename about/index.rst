Hi. My name is Louis. I am a PhD student in machine learning at the `University
of Sydney`_. I am advised by Assoc. Prof. `Fabio Ramos`_, jointly with Dr. 
`Edwin Bonilla`_ at UNSW and Prof. `Richard Nock`_ at ANU/Data61. My main 
research interests lie in variational Bayesian inference, generative models, 
deep learning and the intersection of these approaches.

Previously, I studied computer science at the `University of New South Wales`_ 
(UNSW), where I minored in mathematics and had an emphasis on algorithm design 
and analysis, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and machine 
learning. I undertook my final-year thesis under Assoc. Prof. `Aleksandar Ignjatovic`_, 
and graduated with first-class honours in 2015.

Until 2017, I was a software engineer at `NICTA`_ (now incorporated under the 
`CSIRO`_ as `Data61`_) in the `Inference Systems`_ team, where I worked among a
group of leading machine learning researchers and engineers with expertise in 
Bayesian statistics. Presently, I work at Data61 on a part-time basis.

In my spare time, if I am not working on one of my `many incomplete side 
projects`_, you'll either find me shooting hoops at the gym, or on the mats 
training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, in all likelihood being strangled, probably by a
smaller opponent.

Check out my :doc:`projects <projects>` for the things I've built and my 
:doc:`dev stack <development-stack>` for what I love to build things with.
