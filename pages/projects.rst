  Coursework
  ==========  

  Every semester, I undertake up to a dozen fairly involved projects, 
  whether it be a practical assignment that requires the design and 
  implementation of complex software, or a theoretical assignment 
  that requires problem solving, investigative / critical thinking 
  and other key skills generally demanded by rigorous academic research.  

  Therefore, I feel this experience is just as important and valuable as, 
  if not more than, the experience accumulated from vocational projects.  

  To see the list of subjects I have completed, learn about the work
  involved, and see how I performed, please refer to :doc:`coursework-experience`.
