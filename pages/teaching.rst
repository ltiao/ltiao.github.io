.. topic:: COMP9418 (Advanced Topics in Statistical Machine Learning) - `UNSW Sydney`_

   In Semester 2 2017, I was a teaching assistant for COMP9418_: Advanced Topics 
   in Statistical Machine Learning, a brand new course created and taught by 
   the brilliant `Edwin Bonilla`_. 

   The course has a primary focus on probabilistic machine learning methods, 
   covering the topics of exact and approximate inference in directed and 
   undirected probabilistic graphical models - continuous latent variable 
   models, structured prediction models, and non-parametric models based on 
   Gaussian processes. 

   There was major emphasis on maintaining a good balance between theory and 
   practice, and my primary responsibility was creating lab exercises to 
   help students gain hands-on experience in applying these methods on 
   real-world data with the current tools and libraries. 
   The labs were purely implemented in Python, and relied heavily on the Python 
   scientific computing and data analysis stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, 
   Seaborn, Pandas, IPython/Jupyter notebooks), and the popular machine 
   learning libraries scikit-learn and TensorFlow. 

   Students were given the chance to experiment with a broad range of methods 
   on various problems, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian 
   logistic regression, probabilistic PCA (PPCA), factor analysis (FA) and 
   independent component analysis (ICA) for dimensionality reduction, hidden 
   Markov models (HMMs) for speech recognition, conditional random fields (CRFs) 
   for named-entity recognition, and Gaussian processes (GPs) for regression and
   classification.
