Hi. My name is Louis. I am a budding machine learning research scientist and a 
current PhD candidate at the `University of Sydney`_ under `Fabio Ramos`_. 
I also work with `Edwin Bonilla`_ at UNSW and `Richard Nock`_ at ANU/Data61. 
My main research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian statistics, 
deep learning and implicit generative models.

I have a thorough background in computer science and mathematics.
Previously, I studied computer science at the `University of New South Wales`_ 
(UNSW), where I had a major emphasis on algorithm design and analysis, 
theoretical computer science, programming language theory, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, and a minor emphasis on mathematics and 
statistics. I undertook my final-year thesis under `Aleksandar Ignjatovic`_, 
and graduated with first-class honours in 2015.

Until 2017, I was a software engineer at `NICTA`_ (now incorporated under the 
`CSIRO`_ as `Data61`_) in the `Inference Systems`_ team, where I worked among a
group of experienced machine learning researchers and engineers with a focus on
Bayesian machine learning. Presently, when I am not engaged in 
:doc:`teaching-related activities <teaching>`, I work at Data61 on a part-time 
basis.

In my spare time, if I am not working on one of my `many incomplete side 
projects`_, you'll either find me shooting hoops at the gym, or on the mats 
training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, in all likelihood being strangled, probably by a
smaller opponent.

Check out my :doc:`projects <projects>` for the things I've built and my 
:doc:`dev stack <development-stack>` for what I love to build things with.
