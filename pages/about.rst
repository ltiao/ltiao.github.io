Hi. My name is Louis. I am a lifelong student of Computer Science and 
Mathematics and an aspiring researcher.

I recently graduated with First-class Honours in Computer Science from the 
`University of New South Wales`_, where I minored in Mathematics and 
concentrated on Algorithm Design and Analysis, Theoretical Computer Science, 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I am currently a Software Engineer at `NICTA`_ on the `BDKD (Big Data and 
Knowledge Discovery)`_ project, working with a team of leading Machine 
Learning researchers with expertise in on Nonparametric Bayesian Inference (in 
particular, Gaussian Processes) and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

In my spare time, if I am not working on one of my many incomplete side 
projects, you'll either find me at the gym shooting hoops and trying to 
improve my terrible ball handling, or at home studying the beautiful and 
profound ancient strategy board game known as Weiqi, or more commonly `Go`_.

    * Combinatorial Optimization
    * Computability Theory
    * Complexity Theory

    On the less theoretical CS aspect of things, I am a full-stack software engineer, 
    with experience in

    * Server administration, virtualization, networking, and hosting environments 
      (e.g. Amazon EC2, Heroku, DigitalOcean)
    * Database administration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) 
    * Database design / Data modeling
    * Web application frameworks (e.g. Django, Flask) / RESTful APIs
    * User Interface (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, etc.)
      
      - Data Visualization (D3.js, Google Charts, HighCharts JS)

    I am highly effective in Python, and use it regularly for such things as

    * Numerical analysis / scientific computing - (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython[Notebook], scikit-learn)
    * Web data extraction (web scraping/crawling) - (Scrapy + lxml, requests + BeautifulSoup)
    * Network analysis - (NetworkX)
    * *Solving almost any other type of problem*

    Nowadays, though I generally use high-level programming languages such as Python, C++, 
    Java and Haskell, I worked almost exclusively in my earlier days with programming 
    languages such as C and assembly (AVR), for low-level applications such as programming 
    microprocessors (Atmel AVR) or implementing the filesystem and virtual memory for an 
    (educational) operating system (OS/161).
