Hi there. My name is Louis Tiao. I am a perennial student of Computer Science 
and Mathematics. I recently graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science from 
`The University of New South Wales`_, where I minored in Mathematics and 
concentrated on Algorithm Design and Analysis, Theoretical Computer Science, 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I currently work as a Software Engineer at `NICTA`_ in Sydney,
Australia. 

When I am not working on one of my many incomplete side projects, you'll 
probably find me at the gym working on my midrange jumpshot.

..  My current research interests are

    * Algorithm / Data Structure Design and Analysis 
    * Machine Learning / Statistics / Data Mining
    * Artificial Intelligence
    * Discrete Mathematics
    * Combinatorial Optimization
    * Computability Theory
    * Complexity Theory





    On the less theoretical CS aspect of things, I am a full-stack software engineer, 
    with experience in

    * Server administration, virtualization, networking, and hosting environments 
      (e.g. Amazon EC2, Heroku, DigitalOcean)
    * Database administration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) 
    * Database design / Data modeling
    * Web application frameworks (e.g. Django, Flask) / RESTful APIs
    * User Interface (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, etc.)
      
      - Data Visualization (D3.js, Google Charts, HighCharts JS)

    I am highly effective in Python, and use it regularly for such things as

    * Numerical analysis / scientific computing - (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython[Notebook], scikit-learn)
    * Web data extraction (web scraping/crawling) - (Scrapy + lxml, requests + BeautifulSoup)
    * Network analysis - (NetworkX)
    * *Solving almost any other type of problem*

    Nowadays, though I generally use high-level programming languages such as Python, C++, 
    Java and Haskell, I worked almost exclusively in my earlier days with programming 
    languages such as C and assembly (AVR), for low-level applications such as programming 
    microprocessors (Atmel AVR) or implementing the filesystem and virtual memory for an 
    (educational) operating system (OS/161).
