Hi. My name is Louis Tiao. I am currently an Honours-Year student of Computer Science  
at the `University of New South Wales <http://www.unsw.edu.au/>`_ in Sydney, Australia.

My current research interests are

* Algorithm / Data Structure Design and Analysis 
* Machine Learning / Statistics / Data Mining
* Artificial Intelligence
* Discrete Mathematics
* Combinatorial Optimization
* Computability Theory
* Complexity Theory

On the less theoretical CS aspect of things, I am a full-stack software engineer, 
with experience in

* Server administration, virtualization, networking, and hosting environments 
  (e.g. Amazon EC2, Heroku, DigitalOcean)
* Database administration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) 
* Database design / Data modeling
* Web application frameworks (e.g. Django, Flask) / RESTful APIs
* User Interface (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, etc.)
  
  - Data Visualization (D3.js, Google Charts, HighCharts JS)

I am highly effective in Python, and use it regularly for such things as

* Numerical analysis / scientific computing - (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython[Notebook], scikit-learn)
* Web data extraction (web scraping/crawling) - (Scrapy + lxml, requests + BeautifulSoup)
* Network analysis - (NetworkX)
* *Solving almost any other type of problem*

Nowadays, though I generally use high-level programming languages such as Python, C++, 
Java and Haskell, I worked almost exclusively in my earlier days with programming 
languages such as C and assembly (AVR), for low-level applications such as programming 
microprocessors (Atmel AVR) or implementing the filesystem and virtual memory for an 
(educational) operating system (OS/161).

When I am not working on one of my many incomplete side projects, you'll probably
find me on the blacktop working on my midrange jumpshot.
